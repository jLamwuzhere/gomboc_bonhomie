# gomboc_bonhomie
Gomboc Bonhomie is a social media app using MERN stack that will be built out further over time. While starting out very basic in functionality, the goal is to build out a social media site that brings already familiar communities together in more real ways and with less pseudo-interactions. It's not about competing to grow your influence. Our goal is to help foster the relations you already have. (If you add new bonhomies, that's cool too.) The name translates roughly to "sphere of influence", "circle of friends", or even "balanced, good natured people". We also like to think of it as our unique close-knit friendship groups.
